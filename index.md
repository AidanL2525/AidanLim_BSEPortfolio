# Aidan's Three Joint Robotic Arm
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone 

My second Milestone shows the compatibility of the servo to my Arduino. The micro servo has many gears and a small circuit board that can control how much the gears turn through inputs. These inputs can be read through my Arudino IDE on my computer that outputs the information to my Arduino. The data then flows through the three female to female wires into the servo's circuit board. The numbers I input are numerical and each represents an angle. For example, if I input the number 3, the servo will rotate 60 degrees. These servos will be used to move the base, joints, and pincers of the robotic arm. So far, the instructions have been fairly easy to follow, only consisting of testing the robotic components. 

The problem I had faced during my second Milestone was trying to get 

# First Milestone

For your first milestone, describe what your project is and how you plan to build it. You can include:
- An explanation about the different components of your project and how they will all integrate together
- Technical progress you've made so far
- Challenges you're facing and solving in your future milestones
- What your plan is to complete your project

My first Milestone demonstrates the functions of the joystick to my Arduino. The displacement of the joystick is measured using a potentiometer. Potentiometers create a graph that contain x and y axes to display the location numarically of the joystick. These inputs are first fed through three female to female wires into the Arduino to finally transfer into the Arduino IDE on my computer. The output is shown using a serial motor that constantly sends lines of x, y, and z points depending on the joystick position. But the z axis will stay as 0 beacause the potentiometer does not calculate the displacment in height even when the joystick is pressed down. I have currently not built anything of the physical robot, but have only tested my systems and code.

The only minor problems I had faced during my first Milestone was trying to place the female to female wires onto the Arduino pins. The pins are tightly grouped and leave very little space for each wire to slot in. The heads of the wire were also very loose, making it very easy to unplug if tugged slightly. The only solution to my challenges are to be careful with the wires and to have patience when connecting them to my Arduino.

My plan to complete my project is to follow each and every step of my main project guide properly and precisely. 

<!--- # Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.

# Starter Project: Retro Arcade Console 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UlN1hSnhQcY?si=dF2FZOEe-0TgTIOz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This is the Retro Arcade Console Starter Project. The console uses the pre-soldered CPU on the board to read the input of the seven buttons to determine its next action based of its pre-coded information. It sends binary code, series of 1's and 0's, to the LED's to tell each LED to either turn on or off. There are two options to power the arade: USB and batteries. The Arcade is powered by three AAA batteries, connected through a red and black wire to the USB port to describute energy to all components. 

I fought against two main problems: making the buzzer work and going back to fix my work. The instructors and I could not fix it because we did not understand why it is shorting. The two solders were very far apart yet the multimeter was still reading a short. We tried using a wick to pick up any metal particles inbetween the two solders and Another problem I faced was having the fix my mistakes along the way. I strugged on having to go back on my work to make all of the components work properly. I had many errors such as the solder not fully touching the board and some shorts on the LED panel that caused two columns of LED's to not function. 

The lesson I learned with my starter project is to be cautious and accurate with my work. This will help me progess through my final project smoothly without any difficulties. After finishing my starter project, I will be working on my main project which is the three joint robotic arm.
